## Visual Tracking with Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF)
The work conducted in this repo is inspired by the [work done by Martin Danelljan et al.](http://www.cvl.isy.liu.se/research/objrec/visualtracking/scalvistrack/index.html).

# Setup
1. Install pipenv by running *pip install --user pipenv*
2. Go to root of this project (DCF) and run *python3 -m pipenv install*
3. To activate virtual environment run *python3 -m pipenv shell*
4. Exit environment by running *exit* in bash
All work should be performed inside the virtual environment.
